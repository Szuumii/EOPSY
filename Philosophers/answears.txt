2. Why m mutex is initialized with 1 and mutexes from the array s are initialized with 0's?

Mutex m was initialized with 1 due to the fact that while entering a critical reagion we don't want any other thread to interfere with the data included in it. This chagne might happen only by the thread
that is currently in critical reagion only.
Array s of mutexes is initialized with  in order to prohibit a philosopher thread after an attepmt to grab forks. In such a case philosopher may be unlocked by it's neighbour which signals them that they can move on
to the eating phase using test method if the conditions are met.
